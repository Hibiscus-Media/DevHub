# ES10 Features and Exercises

## Introduction to ES10 (ECMAScript 2019)

ES10 (also known as ECMAScript 2019) introduced several new features to JavaScript that make working with arrays, strings, and error handling much more convenient. This document covers some of the most important features of ES10:

- **Array `.flat()` and `.flatMap()`**
- **String trimming methods (`trimStart()` and `trimEnd()`)**
- **Object `fromEntries()` method**
- **Enhanced error handling with `try` and `catch`**

We will also go through exercises that demonstrate these features in practice.

---

## 1. Array `.flat()`

The `flat()` method creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.

### Example of `flat()`:

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5]]];
console.log(array.flat(2)); 
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The `flat()` method in this example flattens the array to the depth level of 2.

---

## 2. Array `.flatMap()`

`flatMap()` combines the mapping of an array and flattening the result into a single method. It first applies a function to each element, then flattens the result by one level.

### Example of `flatMap()`:

```javascript
const greeting = [["Hello", "young", "grasshopper!"], ["you", "are"], ["learning", "fast!"]];
console.log(greeting.flatMap(x => x.join(' ')));
// Output: ['Hello young grasshopper!', 'you are', 'learning fast!']
```

This method allows us to map each array element, join the sub-elements into a string, and then flatten the array in a single step.

## 3. String `.trimStart()` and `.trimEnd()`

These two methods allow you to remove whitespace from the beginning or end of a string.

### Example of `trimStart()` and `trimEnd()`:

```javascript
const userEmail = '    example@email.com   ';
console.log(userEmail.trimStart());  // Removes leading spaces
console.log(userEmail.trimEnd());    // Removes trailing spaces
```

---

## 4. Object `fromEntries()`

`Object.fromEntries()` transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object. It does the opposite of `Object.entries()`.

### Example of `fromEntries()`:

```javascript
const entries = [['name', 'Alice'], ['age', 25], ['role', 'admin']];
const obj = Object.fromEntries(entries);
console.log(obj); 
// Output: { name: 'Alice', age: 25, role: 'admin' }
```

---

## 5. Enhanced Error Handling with `try` and `catch`

In ES10, the `catch` block no longer requires an error parameter, making it cleaner when you don't need to use the error object.

### Example of `try` and `catch`:

```javascript
try {
  // Some code that might throw an error
  throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
} catch {
  console.log('An error occurred, but we do not need the error object.');
}
```

## Exercises

Here are a few exercises to test your understanding of the new ES10 features:

---

### 1. Turn this array into a new array: `[1,2,3,[4],[5]]`. 
**Bonus** if you can do it on one line.

```javascript
const array = [[1],[2],[3],[[[4]]],[[[5]]]];
console.log(array.flat(2)); 
// Output: [1, 2, 3, [4], [5]]
```

---

### 2. Turn this array into a new array: `[ 'Hello young grasshopper!', 'you are', 'learning fast!' ]`

```javascript
const greeting = [["Hello", "young", "grasshopper!"], ["you", "are"], ["learning", "fast!"]];
console.log(greeting.flatMap(x => x.join(' '))); 
// Output: ['Hello young grasshopper!', 'you are', 'learning fast!']
```

---

### 3. Turn the greeting array above into a string: `'Hello young grasshopper you are learning fast!'`

```javascript
console.log(greeting.flatMap(x => x.join(' ')).join(' ')); 
// Output: 'Hello young grasshopper you are learning fast!'
```

---

### 4. Turn the trapped number into `[3]`

```javascript
const trapped = [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[3]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]];
console.log(trapped.flat(Infinity)); 
// Output: [3]
```

---

### 5. Clean up this email to have no whitespaces. Make the answer be in a single line (return a new string):

```javascript
const userEmail3 = '     cannotfillemailformcorrectly@gmail.com   ';
console.log(userEmail3.trimEnd().trimStart()); 
// Output: 'cannotfillemailformcorrectly@gmail.com'
```

---

### 6. Turn the below users (value is their ID number) into an array: `[ [ 'user1', 18273 ], [ 'user2', 92833 ], [ 'user3', 90315 ] ]`

```javascript
const users = { user1: 18273, user2: 92833, user3: 90315 };
const usersArray = Object.entries(users);
console.log(usersArray);
// Output: [['user1', 18273], ['user2', 92833], ['user3', 90315]]
```

---

### 7. Multiply the users' IDs by 2. Should output: `[ [ 'user1', 36546 ], [ 'user2', 185666 ], [ 'user3', 180630 ] ]`

```javascript
const updatedUsersArray = usersArray.map(user => [user[0], user[1] * 2]);
console.log(updatedUsersArray);
// Output: [['user1', 36546], ['user2', 185666], ['user3', 180630]]
```

---

### 8. Turn the array back into an object with all the users' IDs updated to their new version.

```javascript
const updatedUsers = Object.fromEntries(updatedUsersArray);
console.log(updatedUsers);
// Output: { user1: 36546, user2: 185666, user3: 180630 }
```

---

## Conclusion

ES10 introduced several important features such as array flattening (`flat()` and `flatMap()`), string trimming (`trimStart()` and `trimEnd()`), and converting arrays to objects with `fromEntries()`. These features improve the readability and usability of JavaScript, allowing developers to handle data transformations more efficiently.
