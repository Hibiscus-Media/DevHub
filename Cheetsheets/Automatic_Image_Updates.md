# Setting Up GitHub Project with Automated Image Updates

## 1. Create the Project Folder Structure
Start by setting up a local Git repository to hold your project files. Here’s the recommended structure:

```bash
/Learn_Japanese
│
├── .gitignore        # To exclude unnecessary files
├── README.md         # Optional project description
├── index.html        # The webpage that will display the images
└── Phrases/
    ├── Day1/         # Each folder represents a day's worth of images
    │   ├── phrase1.jpeg
    │   ├── phrase2.jpeg
    ├── Day2/
    └── ...
```

---

## 2. Initialize Git
Navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/Learn_Japanese
```

Initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

---

## 3. Set Up GitHub Pages
Create a repository on GitHub with the same name as your project, e.g., `Learn_Japanese`.

Push the repository to GitHub using the following commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Learn_Japanese.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Enable GitHub Pages:

- Go to your repository on GitHub.
- Click **Settings > Pages**.
- Under "Source," select the `main` branch and set it to the root folder.
- Click **Save**. This will create a live GitHub Pages site at:

```bash
https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/Learn_Japanese/
```

---

## 4. Create the Post-Commit Hook to Automate Image Addition
The post-commit hook will automatically update the `index.html` file with newly added images from the `Phrases/` folder. This script needs to be placed inside the `.git/hooks` folder.

### Steps:
Navigate to the `.git/hooks/` directory:

```bash
cd .git/hooks
```

Create a file called `post-commit` and open it in a text editor:

```bash
touch post-commit
nano post-commit
```

Paste the following script into the `post-commit` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

image_dir="Phrases/"
html_file="index.html"

# Start building the HTML content
echo "<!DOCTYPE html>" > $html_file
echo "<html lang='en'>" >> $html_file
echo "<head><meta charset='UTF-8'><meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'><title>Daily Japanese Phrases</title>" >> $html_file
echo "<style>.gallery {display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around;}.gallery img {max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;}</style></head>" >> $html_file
echo "<body><h1>Daily Japanese Phrases</h1>" >> $html_file

# Loop through each day's folder and add images
for folder in "$image_dir"*; do
  day=$(basename "$folder")  # Extract folder name (e.g., Day1)
  echo "<h2>$day</h2><div class='gallery'>" >> $html_file
  
  # Loop through each .jpg and .jpeg file in the folder
  for img in "$folder"/*.{jpg,jpeg}; do
    if [[ -f "$img" ]]; then  # Only process if it's a file
      img_filename=$(basename "$img")  # Extract image file name
      echo "<img src='$folder/$img_filename' alt='Phrase Image'>" >> $html_file  # Add image tag to HTML
    fi
  done

  echo "</div>" >> $html_file
done

# Close the HTML file
echo "</body></html>" >> $html_file

# Stage and commit the updated HTML file
git add $html_file
git commit -m "Update index.html with correct image paths"
git push origin main
```

Save and close the file, and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

This script will automatically update the `index.html` file every time you commit new images, and then it will push the changes to GitHub.

---

## 5. Add and Commit New Images
Each time you add new images to your `Phrases/` folder, follow these steps:

Add new images to any day folder inside `Phrases/` (e.g., `Phrases/Day1`).

Stage and commit the changes:

```bash
git add Phrases/*
git commit -m "Added new images"
```

Push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

The post-commit hook will automatically regenerate the `index.html` file and push the updated file to GitHub. Your live site (GitHub Pages) will automatically update with the new images.

---

## 6. Check Your GitHub Pages Site
Once you’ve pushed the changes, visit your GitHub Pages site to see the updated image gallery:

```bash
https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/Learn_Japanese/
```

---

## 7. (Optional) Customize the Style
You can modify the style inside the `index.html` generated by the post-commit hook. For example, you can adjust the layout, image sizes, margins, and more by updating the CSS section in the script:

```bash
echo "<style>.gallery {display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around;}.gallery img {max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;}</style></head>" >> $html_file
```

Feel free to experiment with the layout to fit your needs.

---

## Summary of the Process
1. Set up the folder structure with `Phrases/DayX` folders containing images.
2. Initialize a Git repository and push it to GitHub.
3. Enable GitHub Pages to create a live site.
4. Create a post-commit hook to automate updating the HTML gallery when new images are added.
5. Add, commit, and push new images, and the system will automatically update the site.
