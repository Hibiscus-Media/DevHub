# Complete Markdown Guide

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to format text. Below is a comprehensive guide to everything amazing you can do with Markdown.

## 1. Headings
You can create headings using `#`. The number of `#` symbols denotes the heading level.

# Heading 1  
## Heading 2  
### Heading 3  
#### Heading 4  
##### Heading 5  
###### Heading 6

## 2. Emphasis
You can make text **bold**, *italic*, or both.

**This is bold text**  
*This is italic text*  
***This is bold and italic***

## 3. Lists

### Unordered Lists
Use `-`, `*`, or `+` to create unordered lists.

- Item 1  
- Item 2  
  - Subitem 2.1  
  - Subitem 2.2

### Ordered Lists
Create ordered lists using numbers.

1. First item  
2. Second item  
   1. Subitem 2.1  
   2. Subitem 2.2  

### Task Lists
You can create task lists using square brackets `[ ]`.

- [x] Completed task  
- [ ] Incomplete task  

## 4. Links
You can add hyperlinks by placing the text in brackets and the URL in parentheses.

## 5. Images
Images can be added similarly to links, but with an exclamation mark `!` at the start.

## 6. Blockquotes
To create blockquotes, use the `>` symbol.

> This is a blockquote.

You can also nest blockquotes.

> This is a blockquote.  
>> This is a nested blockquote.  

## 7. Code Blocks
You can create inline code with backticks, like this: `console.log('Hello World');`. For block code, use triple backticks for longer code snippets.

\`\`\`javascript  
console.log('Hello World');  
\`\`\`

## 8. Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal line, use three or more dashes, underscores, or asterisks.

---  
___  
***

## 9. Tables
Create tables using pipes `|` and dashes `-` for the header.

| Name       | Age  | Occupation  |  
|------------|------|-------------|  
| Johnathan  | 32   | Developer   |  
| Sarah      | 28   | Designer    |  

## 10. Escaping Characters
If you need to use Markdown symbols without them being interpreted as Markdown, you can "escape" them using a backslash `\`. For example:

\*This will not be italicized\*

## 11. Footnotes
You can add footnotes in Markdown using `[^1]` and reference it like this.

Here is an example footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote text.

## 12. Links with Titles
You can add a title to a link, which shows when you hover over it:

## 13. Strikethrough
You can strike through text using two tildes `~~`.

~~This text is crossed out~~

## 14. HTML in Markdown
You can also embed HTML in Markdown, which allows for more control if needed.

\`\`\`html  
<div style="color: blue;">  
  This text is blue.  
</div>  
\`\`\`

## 15. Inline HTML Elements
Inline elements like `<strong>` and `<em>` can also be used.

This is <strong>bold</strong> and this is <em>italic</em> using HTML.
