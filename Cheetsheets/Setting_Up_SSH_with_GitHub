# Setting Up SSH with GitHub

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create an SSH key, add it to GitHub, and push your code using SSH.

## Step 1: Generate an SSH Key
First, you need to generate a new SSH key. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_github_email@example.com"
```

If your system doesn’t support ed25519, use RSA instead:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_github_email@example.com"
```

Replace `"your_github_email@example.com"` with the email address associated with your GitHub account.  
Press Enter to accept the default file location.  
If prompted, enter a passphrase or leave it blank.

---

## Step 2: Start the SSH Agent and Add Your Key
To start the SSH agent in the background, run:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Next, add your new SSH key to the SSH agent:

For **ed25519**:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

For **RSA**:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

---

## Step 3: Copy the SSH Key to Your Clipboard
Now, copy your SSH public key to the clipboard.

For **ed25519**:

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

For **RSA**:

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

If `pbcopy` isn’t available, you can manually copy the output using:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

---

## Step 4: Add the SSH Key to GitHub
1. Go to your [GitHub SSH settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).
2. Click **New SSH Key**.
3. In the "Title" field, name your key (e.g., "My SSH Key").
4. Paste the SSH key into the "Key" field.
5. Click **Add SSH Key**.

---

## Step 5: Test the SSH Connection
To make sure everything is set up correctly, test your SSH connection by running:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a message like:

```text
Hi yourusername! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

---

## Step 6: Update the Remote URL to SSH
Navigate to your project directory and update the remote URL to use SSH instead of HTTPS:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

Replace `yourusername` and `yourrepository` with your GitHub username and the repository name.

---

## Step 7: Push Your Changes
Now, you can push your changes using SSH:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors or issues, ensure the SSH key is added to GitHub correctly and that the remote URL has been updated.
